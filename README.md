# React Testing Workshop

You will find 3 branches in this repository.

The `main` branch contains the backend.

The `starter` branch contains the React application without tests.

The `solution` branch contains the React application with tests.

To run the Cypress tests, you will have to also be running the backend in another terminal tab (so you will need to download this repository twice).

## Coffee Shop

You can start the React app with `npm start`.

Note: You will also need to be running the server from the `main` branch for the application to open.
You can either clone the repository twice or download the branches as zip files from GitHub.

## Starter Code

This branch is the starter code (without any React tests).

The `solution` branch has the solution code.
