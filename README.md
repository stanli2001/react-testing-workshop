# React Testing Workshop

You will find 3 branches in this repository.

The [main](https://github.com/bignerdranch/react-testing-workshop) branch contains the backend.

The [starter](https://github.com/bignerdranch/react-testing-workshop/tree/starter) branch contains the React application without tests.

The [solution](https://github.com/bignerdranch/react-testing-workshop/tree/solution) branch contains the React application with tests.

To run the application locally or the Cypress tests, you will have to also be running the backend in another terminal tab (so you will need to download this repository twice).

## Coffee Shop

You can start the React app with `npm start`.

Note: You will also need to be running the server from the `main` branch for the application to open.
You can either clone the repository twice or download the branches as zip files from GitHub.

You can run the unit tests with `npm test`.

You can run the Cypress tests with `npm run cypress:open` or `npm run cypress:run`.
Note: The Cypress tests will only work if you are also running `npm start` in another terminal and running the server.
(In total, you will need three terminal windows running.)

## Solution Code

This branch is the solution code.

The `starter` branch has the stater code.
